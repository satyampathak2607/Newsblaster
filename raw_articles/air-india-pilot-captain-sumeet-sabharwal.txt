A sombre silence hung over Jal Vayu Vihar in Mumbaiâs Powai on Tuesday morning, as Captain Sumeet Sabharwalâs body returned home.
The Air India pilot, who died in last weekâs Flight AI-171 crash in Ahmedabad, was brought back to the neighbourhood where he had spent most of his life.
Family, friends, neighbours, and colleagues gathered to offer their final respects. However, one of the most heartbreaking moments came when Captain Sabharwalâs 88-year-old father, visibly shattered, stood beside his son’s coffin and performed the final prayers.

A retired DGCA official himself, he had been looking forward to spending more time with his son, who was just months away from retirement. That moment will now never come.
Neighbours who had known him for years remembered him with warmth and pride. âThe family has been here for decades. Heâs left a legacy of grace and courage,â said one. Another told NDTV, âWe didnât speak much, but I know he mustâve done everything to save lives. He was a hero. Iâm deeply disturbed.â

At 56, Captain Sabharwal was the senior-most crew member on the flight. According to DGCA records, he had logged over 8,200 flying hours â though many of his colleagues believe his true experience was even greater, with older hours possibly missing from the current system.
âI flew with him for many decades,â an emotional former cabin crew member told NDTV. âWe shared meals, memories, and long hauls. He was a dedicated son and an incredibly skilled pilot. Always peaceful, composed, and grounded. Never flaunted his position, just a wonderful soul.â
Initial reports suggest Captain Sabharwal issued a
“Mayday” call
shortly after takeoff, possibly trying to steer the aircraft away from densely populated areas. His actions may have saved many lives in that final moment of crisis.
“He tried his best. He sacrificed his life to save others. I salute him,” a close friend told the news outlet. While another added, “Sumeet was a wonderful person. I can’t control my tears. He took such loving care of his father. So calm, so patient. We’ve lost a truly good human being.”

He is survived by his elder sister, who lives in Delhi. As reported by The Indian Express, her two sons have followed in their uncleâs footsteps and are both commercial pilots.
After the prayer, the body was taken to the Chakala electric crematorium for the final rites. Through the morning, over a thousand people visited to pay their respects, a powerful reminder of the quiet, enduring impact Captain Sabharwal had on those around him, both in the skies and on the ground.
